*SVInsight* is a python package for calculating an exploratory social vulnerability index. This package calculates SVI using two methods: (1) an iterative factor analysis method and (2) a rank method, both of which have been heavily utilized in scholarly research. This package automates the creation and comparison of indices using U.S. American Community Survey 5-Year Data (ACS5) at the block group or tract level. Users can customize which social, demographic, and economic variables are included in their own custom indices.

This package is a tool to efficiently calculate an exploratory estimate of social vulnerability for a given region. Social vulnerability is an incredibly complex and constantly evolving concept, and researchers, practitioners, and users of this software should always consult relevant peer-reviewed literature and local experts to validate findings.

For user guides, examples, and a more indepth discussion of social vulnerability indices, refer to the [documentation](https://mdp0023.github.io/SVInsight/).

## Installation: 
To quickly install the package, use `pip` to install via PyPI:
    
    pip install SVInsight

SVInsight can then be imported into python:

    >>> from svinsight import SVInsight as svi

SVInsight has dependencies that rely on gdal, which may require its own prior installation based on your operating system and coding environment. 

For example:

* On macOS:
 
      brew install gdal

* On Ubuntu:
 
      sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev

* On Windows:

        pip install gdal==<version> --find-links https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Please refer to the docs website for more detailed installation guides if any problems persist. 


## Quick Guide:

In its simplest form the SVInsight workflow takes 5 lines of code:

    >>> project = svi(project_name, file_path, api_key, geoids)
    >>> project.boundaries_data(boundary, year)
    >>> project.census_data(boundary, year)
    >>> project.configure_variables(config_file)
    >>> project.calculate_svi(config_file, boundary, year)

Some typical compute times that can be expected to run the workflow for various locations at the Block Group level can be found below:

| Location              | Compute Time (seconds) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | 
| Texas                 | 125.75                 | 
| New York              | 120.10                 | 
| Connecticut           | 42.25                  |
| Los Angeles, CA       | 65.60                  |
| Providence County, RI | 27.22                  |
| Travis County, TX     | 26.34                  |
