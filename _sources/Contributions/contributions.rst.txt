Issues, Questions, and Contributions
=====================================

We welcome contributions to the dorado package in the form of pull requests and issues made in the source `repository <https://github.com/mdp0023/SVInsight>`_.

Issues and Questions
--------------------

If you are having any problems using SVInsight we suggest opening an `issue <https://github.com/mdp0023/SVInsight/issues>`_.When you open an issue, please provide a clear description of what your scenario is, and what error message you are receiving. If possible, please include a minimal working example of some code that breaks, and the error output you receive. If there is some functionality you would like to see added to SVInsight you can also open an issue up to discuss that. This can be code you plan to write and contribute, or it can be something you would like to have available but are not comfortable coding yourself. Either way we are happy to help!


Pull Requests
-------------

If you have a feature that you would like to propose be integrated into dorado, then you should open a `pull request <https://github.com/mdp0023/SVInsight/pulls>`_. To create a pull request, we recommend first `forking <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_ the repository, and then creating a separate branch to develop your feature (for reference see the `GitHub flow guide <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_ and this `Git branching <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>`_ guide). Then you can commit and develop your feature in your branch. We ask that new features be accompanied by additional unit tests, to ensure that they operate as expected. For unit testing, we use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_. When you are satisfied with the code you have developed, you can open a pull request to the main branch of the project repository. Please write a concise and descriptive title for the pull request, and provide a clear description of what the feature does and why you are proposing its addition to the project.
